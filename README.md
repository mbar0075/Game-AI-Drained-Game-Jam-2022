## Description of Task:
**Drained** was created as part of the **2022 University of Malta Game Jam** and is a side-scrolling platformer
game. The gameplay revolves around exploring the play area to find collectible items intended to relieve
mental health exhaustion, while avoiding obstacles. The game also adheres to the theme of the **Game
Jam**, which was **Mental Health**, and features several AI-related features which were covered in both
the Game AI and Advanced Game AI courses. Moreover, an effort was made to render the game fun,
whilst exhibiting characteristics of challenging gameplay, a compelling endless mode, and
complementary game mechanics.

The team took great care in making sure that Drained accurately represents the theme of mental health.
This is reflected through the player who, in the game, takes control of a character burdened with the
effects of mental exhaustion. The primary representation of this is a mental health bar visible in the topright corner of the screen, which goes down over time, thus simulating being in a **“draining”** situation. Like real life mental health afflictions, the bar going down does not harm you physically, but negatively
impacts you in other ways. When one is mentally exhausted, common symptoms are reduction in mental
clarity and scattered thoughts.

Another element directly related to the mental health bar are the relaxation spots collected in the first
level of the game. These spots represent recognised ways to treat mental stress, such as exercising or
eating healthy. The idea is that these will help the player to partially restore their mental health
status. However, these also become less effective when used repeatedly, to show that the character is
becoming desensitised to these methods over time.</br>


## "Drained" wins the 2022 Game Jam

> " "Drained" was developed by a mixed team of eight students from different departments. The game tackled the issue of mental exhaustion and fatigue, and the judges praised it for its engaging gameplay and thought-provoking message.
>
> In "Drained", players take on the role of a character struggling with mental exhaustion and fatigue. The game uses a unique mechanic where players must carefully manage their mental energy to survive. As the game progresses, players must make difficult decisions that will impact their character's mental state.
>
> The game was developed using a combination of graphics, and it features a beautiful and immersive art style. The game's music and sound effects also added to the overall atmosphere and helped to create a truly engaging experience for players. "

## Role:
I actively contributed to the development and implementation of all major AI functionality and game components. Through dedicated effort and expertise, I was responsible for coding and integrating various features to enhance the game's performance and user experience. Additionally, as one of the Project Managers, I played a crucial role in coordinating the team and facilitating effective collaboration. This collective effort resulted in the successful achievement of the project's objectives.</br>


## Game Flow Diagram:
The provided Data Flow Diagram (DFD) serves to showcase the intricate functionality inherent in Drained. It encompasses the entire game flow, encompassing the manipulation of game variables such as volume sliders. Furthermore, the DFD visually depicts the comprehensive interplay between players, the environment, and the enemies, effectively highlighting the intricate interconnectedness of these vital components. By offering a visual representation, the DFD offers valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of player engagement and interaction throughout the game.
